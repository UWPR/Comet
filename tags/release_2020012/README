To compile on linux:

- Type 'make'.  This will generate a binary "comet.exe"


To compile with Microsoft Visual Studio:

- First install MSFileReader from Thermo Fischer Scientific.
  https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/login
  Once registered you will find the software under "Other Software Releases".
  As of 10/19/2020, I use the file "MSFileReader_x64_3.1_SP4.exe".

- Load "Comet.sln" in Visual Studio

- Set the build to "Release" and "x64".

- Right-mouse-click on the "Comet" project and choose "Build".
  This should generate a binary "Comet.exe" in x64/Release.
