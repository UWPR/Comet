/* Illustrate the use of Z_BLOCK, inflatePrime(), and inflateSetDictionary()
   for random access of a compressed file.  A file containing a zlib or gzip
   stream is provided on the command line.  The compressed stream is decoded in
   its entirety, and an index built with access points about every SPAN bytes
   in the uncompressed output.  The compressed file is left open, and can then
   be read randomly, having to decompress on the average SPAN/2 uncompressed
   bytes before getting to the desired block of data.

   An access point can be created at the start of any deflate block, by saving
   the starting file offset and bit of that block, and the 32K bytes of
   uncompressed data that precede that block.  Also the uncompressed offset of
   that block is saved to provide a referece for locating a desired starting
   point in the uncompressed stream.  build_index() works by decompressing the
   input zlib or gzip stream a block at a time, and at the end of each block
   deciding if enough uncompressed data has gone by to justify the creation of
   a new access point.  If so, that point is saved in a data structure that
   grows as needed to accommodate the points.

   To use the index, an offset in the uncompressed data is provided, for which
   the latest accees point at or preceding that offset is located in the index.
   The input file is positioned to the specified location in the index, and if
   necessary the first few bits of the compressed data is read from the file.
   inflate is initialized with those bits and the 32K of uncompressed data, and
   the decompression then proceeds until the desired offset in the file is
   reached.  Then the decompression continues to read the desired uncompressed
   data from the file.

   Another approach would be to generate the index on demand.  In that case,
   requests for random access reads from the compressed data would try to use
   the index, but if a read far enough past the end of the index is required,
   then further index entries would be generated and added.

   There is some fair bit of overhead to starting inflation for the random
   access, mainly copying the 32K byte dictionary.  So if small pieces of the
   file are being accessed, it would make sense to implement a cache to hold
   some lookahead and avoid many calls to extract() for small lengths.

   Another way to build an index would be to use inflateCopy().  That would
   not be constrained to have access points at block boundaries, but requires
   more memory per access point, and also cannot be saved to file due to the
   use of pointers in the state.  The approach here allows for storage of the
   index in a file.
