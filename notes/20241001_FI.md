### Notes 2024/10/01: fragment ion indexing support in Comet

Fragment ion indexing was first introduced by [MSFragger in 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28394336/) and this
strategy has since been adopted in search tools like [MetaMorpheus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29578715/)
and [Sage](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37819886/).  And yes, you are encouraged
to go use MSFragger, MetaMorpheus, Sage and all of the other great search tools out
there.

Fragment ion indexing (abbreviated as "FI" going forward) is supported in Comet as of
[version 2024.02 rev. 0](https://uwpr.github.io/Comet/releases/release_202402.html).
Given this is the first Comet release with FI functionality, we expect to improve on
features, performance, and functionality going forward.


### Running a Comet-FI search

To run a Comet-FI search, first create a plain peptide .idx file.  This file
contains a list of peptides, their unmodified masses, pointers to proteins
that the peptides are present in, and combinatorial bitmasks representing
potential variable modification positions.  A plain peptide .idx file can be
created using the "-i" command line option.  In the first example below, an
.idx file will be created for whatever the search database is specified in
the comet.params file.  In the second example below, the search database
"human.fasta" is specified by the command line option "-D" which will override
the database specified in comet.params. The new .idx file
will be created with the same name as the input FASTA file but with an .idx
extension.  In the second example below, "human.fasta.idx" would be created.

```
comet.exe -i
comet.exe -Dhuman.fasta -i
```

A Comet-FI search is invoked when the search database is an .idx file.
Now that the .idx file is created, just specify it as the search database.  It
can be specified in the "database_name" parameter entry in comet.params or via
the "-D" command line option. The examples below all specify the .idx file
on the command line.

```
comet.exe -Dhuman.fasta.idx somefile.raw
comet.exe -Dhuman.fasta.idx *.mzML
comet.exe -Dhuman.fasta.idx 202410*.mzXML
```

The commands below would be the equivalent FI search if "database_name = human.fasta.idx"
was set in comet.params:

```
comet.exe somefile.raw
comet.exe *.mzML
comet.exe 202410*.mzXML
```

Any time the set of variable modifications or the digestion mass range are changed
(and I'm sure other parameters I'm forgetting right now), you should re-create the
.idx file.  If these parameters do not change, you can use the same .idx file.

Once a Comet-FI search is invoked, the plain peptide file is parsed, all
peptide modification permutations are generated, the bazillion fragment ions
calculated and the FI populated.  Then the input files are queried against
the FI.  If multiple input files are searched (aka "comet *.raw") then the one
time cost of generating the FI, which happens once at the beginning of the search,
can be avoided for all subsequent files being searched.


### Current limitations and known issues with Comet-FI:
- MSFragger's database slicing has not yet been implemented so you must have
  enough RAM to stored the entire FI in memory. Note that for real-time
  search application, database slicing is not feasible.
- Protein n-term and c-term variable modifications are not supported in this initial FI release.
  This fuctionality is expected to be added soon. This means that variable
  modifications are limited to residues and peptide termini.
- Only [variable_mod01 through variable_mod05](https://uwpr.github.io/Comet/parameters/parameters_202402/variable_modXX.html) are supported with FI.
- For each variable_modXX, a maximum of 5 modified residues will be considered in a peptide. This
  might further be limited by the total allowed number of modified residues
  in a peptide controlled by the [max_variable_mods_in_peptide](https://uwpr.github.io/Comet/parameters/parameters_202402/max_variable_mods_in_peptide.html) parameter.

### Memory use performance

There are many factors that go into how much memory will be consumed including:
- database size
- peptide length range
- enzyme constraints including missed cleavages and semi or nonspecific cleavages
- number of variable modifications considered
- mass range of the fragment ions used in the index

I will simply state that one can easily generate over a billion fragment ions in
a standard analysis.  And representing a billion fragment ions in a fragment index
in memory will require many GBs of RAM.  You might get away with some smaller searches
on a 32GB machine.  Many searches can be done on a 64GB box.  And if you're a power
user who wants to analyze MHC peptides requiring no-enzyme searches, make sure you
have a 128GB box before attempting this analysis with this version of Comet.

The following searches were run using 8-cores of an AMD Epyc 7443P processor with
256GB RAM running on Ubuntu linux version 22.04  Search times and memory use are 
noted:

- Yeast forward + reverse (XXXX sequence entries), tryptic, 1 allowed
  missed cleavage, variable mods 16M, peptide length 5 to 50 uses XX GB of RAM
  and completes in XXX.
- Human forward + reverse (1XX,XXX sequence entries), tryptic, 1 allowed
  missed cleavage, variable mods 16M, peptide length 5 to 50 uses XX GB of RAM
  and completes in XXX.
- Human forward + reverse (1XX,XXX sequence entries), tryptic, 1 allowed
  missed cleavage, variable mods 16M, 80STY, peptide length 5 to 50 uses XX GB of RAM
  and completes in XXX.
- Human forward + reverse, no enzyme constraint, no variable mods,
  peptide length range 7 to 15 uses XX GB of RAM
  and completes in XXX.
- Human forward + reverse sequences, no enzyme constraint, 16M variable mod,
  peptide length range 7 to 15 uses XX GB of RAM
  and completes in XXX.
