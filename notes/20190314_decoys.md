### Notes 2019.03.14

Here's some notes on Comet's internally-generated decoy peptides.

- A decoy peptide is generated for each target peptide scored. This guarantees
a 1:1 ratio of target to decoy peptides.

- Decoy peptides keeps a terminal residue fixed (e.g. the last K or R for a
tryptic peptide) and reverses every other residue in the peptide.  For an
enzyme that cleaves n-terminal to a residue, such as AspN, the first residue in
the peptide is fixed and every other residue is reversed.  For example, target
tryptic peptide CLSTWGK will generate a decoy peptide GWTSLCK.  A target AspN
peptide DSANLPQ will generate a decoy peptide DQPLNAS.

- If a residue is modified, the modification will move with the residue in the
decoy peptide e.g. M[15.9949]QEATLSK will generate a decoy peptide
SLTAEQM[15.9949]K. If there were a distance constraint forcing this
modification to only appear on the n-terminal residue of the peptide, this
constraint is not enforced for the decoys.
