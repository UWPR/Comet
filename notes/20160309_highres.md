### Notes 2016.03.09

Here's a Thermo Q Exactive datafile, human target-decoy database search (HeLa cells),
searched with both the high-high and high-low parameter settings.  This plot
compares the high res versus low res fragment ion settings above.  FDR/q-values
are calculated based on Comet's E-value scores.  This plot demonstrates the
advantages of high res search settings for high res MS/MS data.
