### Notes 2022.02.28

Directly searching Thermo RAW files is supported only under Windows

- Comet uses Michael Hoopmann's [MSToolkit file parsing library](https://github.com/mhoopmann/mstoolkit)
to read mass spec data.
- Searching Thermo RAW files directly is supported under Windows only. This is
because Thermo RAW file reading requires the use of a Windows-only file parsing
library that Thermo provides.
- In order to search Thermo RAW files, you will first need to install
the MSFileReader software that is freely available from Thermo.
Grab and install the [MSFileReader_x64.exe available here](https://github.com/thermofisherlsms/MSFileReader).
  - If the above does not work, please install MSFileReader_3.0_SP3.exe. Then you can (optionally) install the updated MSFileReader from the link above. If you do this, do not uninstall MSFileReader_3.0_SP3.exe first.  MSFileReader_3.0_SP3.exe can downloaded by [creating a free account with ThermoFischer Scientific](https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/login). Once registered you will find the software under "Other Releases > Release Archive".
- As this vendor-specific file parsing library is Windows-only, Linux
and macOS Comet binaries are limited to searching the non-vendor specific
formats such as mzML, mzXML, mgf, ms2.
- Under Linux/macOS, you can use msconvert from the [ProteoWizard](https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/) project,
[running under a Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/chambm/pwiz-skyline-i-agree-to-the-vendor-licenses),
to convert vendor files to one of these open formats.
