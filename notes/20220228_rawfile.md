### Notes 2022.02.28

Directly searchng Thermo RAW files is supported only under Windows

- Comet uses Michael Hoopmann's [MSToolkit file parsing library](https://github.com/mhoopmann/mstoolkit)
to read mass spec data.
- Searching Thermo RAW files directly is supported under Windows only. This is
because Thermo RAW file reading requires the use of a Windows-only file parsing
library that Thermo provides.
- In order to search Thermo RAW files, you will first need to install
the MSFileReader software that is freely available from Thermo.
Use [this link to register for an account](https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/login)
and then [grab MSFileReader 3.1 SP4 from this link](https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/download?element=8554997).
- As this vendor-specific file parsing library is Windows-only, Linux
and macOS Comet binaries are limited to searching the non-vendor specific
formats such as mzML, mzXML, mgf, ms2.
- Under Linux, you can use msconvert from the [ProteoWizard](https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/) project,
[running under a Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/chambm/pwiz-skyline-i-agree-to-the-vendor-licenses),
to convert vendor files to one of these open formats.
