### Notes 2022.02.28

Directly searchng Thermo RAW files is supported only under Windows

- Comet uses Michael Hoopmann's [MSToolkit file parsing library](https://github.com/mhoopmann/mstoolkit)
to read mass spec data.
- Searching Thermo RAW files directly is supported under Windows only. This is
because Thermo RAW file reading requires the use of a Windows-only file parsing
library that Thermo provides.
- In order to search Thermo RAW files, you will first need to install
the MSFileReader software that is freely available from Thermo.
Grab and install the [MSFileReader_x64.exe available here](https://github.com/thermofisherlsms/MSFileReader).
- As this vendor-specific file parsing library is Windows-only, Linux
and macOS Comet binaries are limited to searching the non-vendor specific
formats such as mzML, mzXML, mgf, ms2.
- Under Linux/macOS, you can use msconvert from the [ProteoWizard](https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/) project,
[running under a Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/chambm/pwiz-skyline-i-agree-to-the-vendor-licenses),
to convert vendor files to one of these open formats.
