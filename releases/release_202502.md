#### release 2025.02 rev. 0 (2025.02.0), release date 2025/06/04

- Per request, implemented the "[min_precursor_charge](https://uwpr.github.io/Comet/parameters/parameters_202502/min_precursor_charge.html)" parameter.
This, along with the existing "[max_precursor_charge](https://uwpr.github.io/Comet/parameters/parameters_202502/max_precursor_charge.html)"
parameter, allows for searching a restricted precursor charge state range.  Feature requested by the UW Bruce lab.
- Changed allocations of temporary memory during threaded preprocessingâ€¦ by @mhoopmann in https://github.com/UWPR/Comet/pull/78
- Update MSTookit in https://github.com/UWPR/Comet/pull/80
- Deprecated win32 support in Visual Studio.
- NOTE: there is performance/speed issues with the Windows versions of Comet after release 2023.01 rev. 2.
  The performance issue affects release 2024.01 rev.0 through this 2025.02 rev. 0 release.  These
  versions run much slower than they should in Windows. Linux binaries do not appear affected and
  it will be a priority to address the issue.
