#### release 2021.02 rev. 0 (2021.02.0), release date 2021/12/09
- This is the first Comet release since the project was migrate to GitHub. There's no real new
  functionality so there's little incentive for 2021.01.0 users to update to this release.
  Thanks to D. Schweppe and W. Fondrie for the migration and setup.
- Matched fragment neutral loss peaks are now reported for real-time search interface.
- This releases supports macOS, thanks to W. Fondrie for the code contributions.
- This releases addresses the segfault in linux Crux Comet search introduced in the 2021.01.0 release.
  Thanks to C. Grant for debugging the issue.
- This releases modifies Crux Comet output file naming which were initially implemented in the
  2018.01 releases. Unfortunately those changes did not make it back to trunk code so the
  file naming fixes reverted as of the 2019.01.0 release.
